# Current Status of Universal ADK Agent Starter Kit

## What Has Been Extracted

### ✅ Templates Created (with ADK 1.0 patterns):

1. **Simple Agent Template**
   - `.starter-kit/templates/simple_agent/agent.py` - Basic LlmAgent pattern
   - `.starter-kit/templates/simple_agent/tools.py` - Tool creation patterns
   - `.starter-kit/templates/simple_agent/pyproject.toml.template` - Dependencies
   - `.starter-kit/templates/simple_agent/.env.example` - Configuration

2. **RAG Agent Template**
   - `.starter-kit/templates/rag_agent/agent.py` - RAG with Vertex AI
   - `.starter-kit/templates/rag_agent/prompts.py` - RAG-specific prompts

3. **Core Scripts**
   - `setup.py` - Automated setup process
   - `extract.py` - Extraction script (ready to run)
   - `create_agent.py` - Agent creation from templates

### ⚠️ What Still Needs Extraction:

The following components are documented in `extract.py` but need actual extraction from source repositories:

1. **Multi-Agent Templates** (from llm-auditor sub-agents)
2. **Deployment Infrastructure** (from agent-starter-pack)
3. **Testing Framework** (from adk-python)
4. **A2A Protocol** (from a2a-python)
5. **Terraform Modules** (from agent-starter-pack)
6. **CI/CD Pipelines** (from agent-starter-pack)

## How to Complete the Extraction

1. **Clone all source repositories:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack.git
   git clone https://github.com/google/adk-python.git
   git clone https://github.com/google/A2A.git
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai.git
   ```

2. **Run the extraction script:**
   ```bash
   cd universal-adk-agent-starter-kit
   python extract.py
   ```

This will extract all the files listed in `EXTRACTION_SCRIPT.md` from the source repositories.

## What You Can Do Now

Even with partial extraction, you can:

1. **Create simple agents** using the templates that have been created
2. **View the extraction plan** in `extract.py` to see exactly what will be extracted
3. **Run setup.py** to prepare your environment

## Summary

- **Framework is ready** - All scripts and structure are in place
- **Some templates created** - Simple and RAG agent templates with ADK 1.0 patterns
- **Full extraction pending** - Run `extract.py` after cloning source repos to complete

The Universal ADK Agent Starter Kit is designed to extract REAL code from official Google repositories, not create patterns from memory. The extraction script knows exactly which files to get from which repositories.

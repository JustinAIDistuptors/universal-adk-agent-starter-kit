# Universal ADK Agent Starter Kit

> üöß **WORK IN PROGRESS** - This repository is being built by systematically extracting code from official Google ADK repositories. No code has been invented or created from memory.

## Current Status

This repository is in the process of being built by extracting real code from these official sources:
- [google/adk-samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) - ADK 1.0 agent examples
- [GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack) - Production scaffolding
- [google/adk-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python) - Evaluation framework
- [google/a2a-python](https://github.com/google/a2a-python) - Agent communication
- [GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai) - RAG implementations
- [GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples) - Deployment patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**All code in this repository must be extracted from the official sources listed above.** Since Google ADK 1.0 was released on May 20, 2025 (4 days ago), we have no prior knowledge of its implementation and must extract everything from the source repositories.

## Build Progress

- [x] Repository created
- [x] Source repositories identified
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [ ] Code extraction from sources (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Template creation
- [ ] Testing with ADK 1.0
- [ ] Documentation

## How This Repository Is Being Built

1. **Discovery Phase** (COMPLETE) - Located all official ADK 1.0 repositories
2. **Planning Phase** (COMPLETE) - Created extraction plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
3. **Extraction Phase** (CURRENT) - Systematically extracting code from each source
4. **Adaptation Phase** - Making extracted code configurable and universal
5. **Testing Phase** - Validating with ADK 1.0

## Next Steps

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the detailed extraction plan and `NEXT_STEPS.md` for the current action items.

## Contributing

This repository is being built following strict extraction principles. Any contributions must:
1. Reference the exact source file being extracted
2. Include attribution comments
3. Be tested with ADK 1.0

---

*This starter kit will enable rapid development of Google ADK 1.0 agents once the extraction process is complete.*
